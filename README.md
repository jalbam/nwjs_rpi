NW.js port for Raspberry Pi
=============================

[NW.js (formerly node-webkit)](http://nwjs.io/ "NW.js web site") binary compiled for the **ARMv6** used by Raspberry Pi. It also runs on Raspberry Pi 2, Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 400 since they are backward compatible with ARMv6. Other compatible hardware should also be able to run this binary.


## Instructions
1. **You need a _package.nw_** which is just a _.zip_ file with _.nw_ extension that contains your project (at least, it needs an _index.html_ and a _package.json_ inside). The included _package.nw_ is just an example using the [Yasminoku](https://github.com/jalbam/yasminoku "Yasminoku repository") game. Since this is only a port, if you need it you can go to the [official web site of NW.js](http://nwjs.io/ "NW.js project") and read the documentation to know more about _package.nw_, _package.json_, etc.

2. Optional: **merge _nw_ and _package.nw_** into a single file with the following command:
	```
	cat nw package.nw > Your_new_binary_file
	```

3. **Edit _fix_libudev.so.0_ and _fix_libudev.so.1_** and replace _Your_new_binary_file_ found in their code by the real name of your binary file (if you did not merge _nw_ and _package.nw_ together, then replace it by just _nw_).

4. If you need it, **give executable permissions** (and other desired permissions) to _Your_new_binary_file_ (or _nw_) using the **_chmod_** command (as root).

5. Try to **run the binary**:
	```
	./Your_new_binary_file
	```
	If you did not merge the _nw_ and _package.nw_ files in one single file (as explained in _step 2_), you should run this command instead:
	```
	./nw
	```

6. In the case the system complains about **_libudev.so.0_** when you try to run the binary, just type the following command:
	```
	./fix_libudev.so.0
	```
	Likewise, if needed, do the same for **_libudev.so.1_** running this:
	```
	./fix_libudev.so.1
	```
	Note: these two commands above will only work if you have followed the _step 3_ properly before. Each of them only needs to be executed once and never again. **Only execute the script needed and do not execute the other script when not needed** (i.e. no error is thrown).

	If the system complains also about **_libgconf-2.so.4_**, run this:
	```
	sudo apt-get install libgconf-2-4
	```	

	If you see any error regarding **_NSS_** (as for example something like this: _Failed to load NSS libraries_), try running this:
	```
	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/nss/ /usr/lib/nss
	```

7. If all works well, you can **distribute your project**. You will need these files at least (in the same folder): _libffmpegsumo.so_, _nw.pak_ and _Your_new_binary_file_ (or _nw_ and _package.nw_ instead). I would recommend including _fix_libudev.so.0_ and _fix_libudev.so.1_ optionally (modified as explained in _step 3_) if you think others might need them.
